Hi, I'm Nikhil! I'm a software/product engineer excited about making open-source more accessible üöÄ, creating technology to empower communities ‚ú®, and designing for healthcare + education üìö.

Currently, I research AI + health equity at {Harvard} and build agentic evals at {Snowflake}.

Previously, I led infra for scalable AI explainability at {TruEra} [(acq. by Snowflake)](https://www.snowflake.com/en/blog/snowflake-acquires-truera-to-bring-llm-ml-observability-to-data-cloud/), and I graduated from {UNC}, where I researched and built ML models to predict early-stage üî¨ Alzheimer's disease and founded {CS + Social Good} to build technical solutions for research, non-profits, and students. I also directed / mentored a few üíª [hackathons](https://hacknc.com/)  along the way!

Maintaining {Shiki} {Twoslash} {ESLint Stylistic} -->

If you're up for it, take a glance at my [projects](/projects) and [demos](/demos)!

I also do [research](/research) and write [blog posts](/posts) about open source, coding, reproducible data science, AI/ML, etc.

Occasionally, I build games for my friends and apps for my family. I am also learning a few languages <span op75>(Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Japanese, Mandarin)</span>, in the hopes that I may be able to learn more about üåé cultures, especially via food and artistic expression.

<!-- TODO: this is really cool, I'd love to do something like this as well! -->
<!-- From time to time, I make some generative-art, interactivity experiments on [100.antfu.me](https://100.antfu.me/). -->

Outside of programming, I enjoy [photography](/photos), [food](/food), and traveling. I mostly post photos of the latter two. I also love exploring ephemeral worlds - anime, movies, books, and games - feel free to browse some of the [media](/media) I've explored so far. And, if you're curious, here are some of my [bookmarks](/bookmarks) and my current [tech stack](/use).

<!-- TODO: the syntax below is a pretty cool way of putting a translation above text. Here "Tokyo" is above the Japanese kanji(?) for Tokyo  -->
<!-- I recently <a href="/posts/hello-tokyo">moved to <ruby lang="ja">Êù±‰∫¨<rp>(</rp><rt>Tokyo</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby></a>, if you are around, please reach out and let's have some coffee or work together. -->
