I am incredibly fortunate to be involved in communities, both online and offline, that have generously provided me with support, tooling, and resources that others may find beneficial! I deeply respect and appreciate the ` { open-source AI/ML, startup, open education, digital accessibility }` communities, to name a few.

If you're curious about diving into open-source, education, healthcare, or any other fields, but feel uncertain about where begin, or if you're already well on your journey, I would be happy to chat with you and share my experiences and insights! 

### Quick Chat

I want to keep the conversation easy, open, and accessible. You can use the link below to book a 30min chat with me. With respect for your time and mine, I would recommend coming prepared with some initial research and questions in mind. Looking forward to meeting you soon!
