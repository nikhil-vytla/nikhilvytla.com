- Confirm that code renders work
- Add custom art simulations (a la plum/dots)
- write up little blog on OG image generation - perhaps make a tool for it as well!
- write up a little blog on link minifier (and other projects - maybe case studies for more serious projects? or i could do multi-part blogs...)
- write up smaller blog posts on fundamentals from stats, CS, HDS, potential projects
